600101,"1.2083 420 Stainless Tool Steel is a martensitic stainless steel with 12% Chromium which is sufficient to give good corrosive resistance properties. It’s best corrosive resistance is when hardened and surface is ground or polished.It has good ductility in the annealed condition but can be hardened up to 500HB (highest of the chromium grades). Martensitic Grades are known for high hardness and allowances must be
made for poor weldability and usually allowances for a final harden and temper treatment. Steel is magnetic and welding is not recommended."

600064,"Pig iron, also known as crude iron, is an intermediate product of the iron industry in the production of steel which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8–4.7%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.The traditional shape of the molds used for pig iron ingots is a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots at right angles to a central channel or ""runner"", resembling a litter of piglets being nursed by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the ""pigs"") were simply broken from the runner (the ""sow""), hence the name ""pig iron"". As pig iron is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand cause only insignificant problems considering the ease of casting and handling them."

600112,"E2 and E8 are two specific grades of iron scrap defined by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) in North America. E2 iron scrap is typically made up of unalloyed steel or wrought iron with a thickness of at least 1/8 inch (3.175 mm). E8 iron scrap, on the other hand, contains a minimum of 0.5% copper and/or a minimum of 0.5% chrome and/or a minimum of 0.5% nickel, with a thickness of at least 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).

The exact composition of E2 and E8 iron scrap can vary depending on the source and the specific product being referred to. However, in general, E2 scrap is made up of relatively clean, unalloyed steel or wrought iron, while E8 scrap can contain a range of alloying elements, including copper, chrome, and nickel, which can give it improved mechanical and/or corrosion-resistant properties. The specific amounts of these elements can vary depending on the source and the intended application of the scrap."

600099,"X-ray film displays the radiographic image and consists of emulsion (single or double) of silver halide (silver bromide (AgBr) is most common) which when exposed to light, produces a silver ion (Ag+) and an electron. The electrons get attached to the sensitivity specks and attract the silver ion. Subsequently, the silver ions attach and clumps of metallic silver (black) are formed 1,2.

The silver can be reclaimed from old x-ray film, in a process known as silver recovery.

Layers
base: cellulose triacetate or polyester for support
substratum: an adhesive layer containing gelatin and solvents that bind emulsion and base
emulsion: silver halide and gelatin, with some hardening agents is the main layer where latent images are stored
protective layer: gelatin, protects emulsion from damage
The total thickness of the film is about 0.25 mm.

Types
screen type films: faster when used with intensifying screen
conventional
orthochromatic (green sensitive)
direct exposure type: used for dental exposures"

600263,"CuZn15 is a solid solution strengthened copper alloy containing 15% zinc (brass). CuZn15 has
very good cold fomability and is suited for bending, stamping and other cold forming processes.
The alloy may be soldered, brazed or welded.
As the zinc content increases, the strength improves, yet the conductivity and ductility are
reduced. CuZn15 has a good resistance to stress corrosion cracking, yet the alloy should be
stress relieved if exposed to an ammonia atmosphere.
Due to the raised zinc content brass has economical advantages.
CuZn15 is a widely used alloy with an excellent combination of strength, ductility and corrosion
resistance.
Fields of application are stamped and deep drawn products, dry goods, jewelry, cosmetic
packaging and components of mechanical and electrical engineering and building technology.

600150,"Tinplate is light gauge, cold-reduced low-carbon steel sheet or strip, coated on both faces with commercially pure tin. It thus combines in one material the
strength and formability of steel and the corrosion resistance, solderability and good appearance of tin. Within this broad description, there exists today an
extremely wide range of products, tailor-made to meet particular end-use requirements. Production of the steel base and its subsequent coating with tin
are independent of each other, so that any set of properties in the steel, can in theory be combined with any tin coating. The composition of the steel used for
tinplate is closely controlled and according to the grade chosen and its manner of processing, various types with different formabilities (“tempers”) can be
produced. Tinplate is sold in a range of steel thicknesses, from around 0.5 mm to 0.13 mm. The steel can be coated with differing thicknesses of tin, and even
different thicknesses on the two faces (differential coatings) may be produced to cater for varying conditions at the internal and external surfaces of a container.
A variety of surface finishes are also produced for diverse applications. Tinplate has a special passivation treatment to stabilise the surface and improve adhesion
of lacquers; it also carries a very thin film of an oil to improve its handling and fabrication properties. This oil is, of course, compatible with food products.
The resulting wide variety of materials gives the user a great flexibility in choice and the ability to select precisely the right material for a given end use."

“delta phase” in the microstructure which is very hard and presence of this phase provides the good
wear properties. Increased tensile strength can be achieved by adding nickel for higher load bearing
applications. When keyways or splines are required, Gear Bronze can be cast bi-metallic using MCC grade
MC90 for the inner layer (core). MC90 is a Manganese Bronze that provides higher strength, therefore higher
load bearing. Bi-metallic gears provide a combination of strength and wear properties. Since Manganese
Bronze is cheaper than the Tin Bronze, there is also cost savings. Applications for Gear Bronze include
worm gears, bearings, bushings, valve bodies and speed reducers."

600121,"The chemical composition of brass can vary depending on the specific type or grade of brass, as there are many different formulations with different properties and applications. However, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) has established general guidelines for the composition of various grades of brass scrap, which are commonly used in the recycling industry.

According to the ISRI ""Yellow Brass"" specification, which is one of the most common types of brass scrap, the chemical composition is typically:

Copper (Cu): 60-63%
Zinc (Zn): 33-37%
Lead (Pb): maximum of 0.5%
Tin (Sn): maximum of 0.2%
Iron (Fe): maximum of 0.35%
Aluminum (Al): maximum of 0.5%
Manganese (Mn): maximum of 0.5%
It's important to note that these are just general guidelines and that the actual composition of brass can vary depending on the specific manufacturing process and other factors."
